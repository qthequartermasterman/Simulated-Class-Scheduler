1. How much time did you spend on this assignment?
I spent approximately 7 hours or so on this assignment, by the time I had to rewrite a huge chunk of it.
2. When did you start working on this assignment?
I started working on this assignment immediately after class on the day it was assigned.
3. Did you find this homework to be easy or difficult and why?
The assignment was easy once I realized that I putting a bunch of functions that should have been in Enrollments in the Courses object, and was confused why I couldn't easily get access to data. Once I figured that part out, I was able to finish it in about three hours or so, with minimal difficulty.
4. What did you learn about problem solving and time management from this assignment?
When designing functions, one must keep in mind the data that a particular class has access to, and how to avoid requesting data from other classes where possible.
I am glad I started early, so I could fail at my design the first time around with ample time to remain.
5. What will you do differently on this assignment
I will make a list of what data that every potential function needs before trying to decide the best place to put said functions.
6. What portions of this assignment did you have the most trouble completing?
See above.
For some reason, the make file was extremely confusing, (chasing the descendancies). I'm not sure why. It makes perfect sense now that I've done it.
7. Any other comments related to your performance on this assignment.
It was a fun assignment to do. Thanks!
